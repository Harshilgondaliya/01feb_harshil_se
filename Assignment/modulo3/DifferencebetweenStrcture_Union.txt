< STRUCTURE >

                > The keyword (struct) is used to define a Structure.

                > Consume more space thane union.

                > Each member within a structure is assigned unique storage area of location.

                > Altering the value of member will not affect other members of the structure.

                > Individual member can be accessed at a time.

                > Several member of a structure can initialize at once.




< UNION >

                > The keyword (union) is used to define a union.

                > Consume less space than structure.

                > Memory allocated is shared by individual members of union.

                > Altering the value of any of the member will alter other member values.

                > Only one member can be accessed at a time.

                > Only the first member of a union can be initialized.
